# Bootstrap-ultra-buttons-system
Highly customisable Bootstrap 4's button system, change a few values, compile sass and get customs styled bootstrap buttons.

##Story behind this project
Here is the deal, bootstrap provides 6 default button classes: `Primary, Secondary, Info, Success, Warning, Danger` but what if you want name them diffrently? what if you don't want 6 classes at all? for example in a project i only want 3 button classes: `Primary, Secondary, Tertiary`, it becomes very tedious to implement this, overriding the correct css rules, structuring css files just like bootstrap structures theirs, then deleting not-so-usefull classes.

Bootstrap ultra buttons systems does this for you, sass-script(maps) can solve this very gracefully. Just edit the main sass map(sort-of variable), compile your sass and you are Done!
